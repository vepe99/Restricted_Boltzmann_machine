Small enunciation of the problem
One hot encoding
- explain the choices of 1,-1,-1,-1 for the vectors
- 1000 could be a good idea, too, but was too limited
Explain RMSprop
- how we implemented it
- Adam returns similar results, was not used
	- Include two best results later in the analysis
How to increase CD
- for cycle was implemented, updating weigths appropriately
Usage of 10 or -11
- no good results in the range of temperatures was found
- physical reasoning: -1 is inclusive. 0 kills the weigths from h
Explain additional metrics and tests
- Include .py libraries 
- Comment the meaning of these metrics
Inlcude Giacomo's class with proper explanation
- Refactor the code
Show heatmaps
- explain the choice of temperatures
- 10
- -11
Explain patterns in W and biases (Baiesi's graph)
- use Baiesi graph or our matshow (adjust colormap)
- implement point 6.1 as a matrix mutiplication
- explain weigths patterns
